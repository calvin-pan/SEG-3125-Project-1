          Yes, our hair salon has a cancellation policy in place. We understand that circumstances may arise where you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, and we strive to accommodate our clients' needs while also ensuring the smooth operation of our salon.

          Our cancellation policy requires that you provide us with at least 24 hours' notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. This allows us to offer the time slot to another client who may be waiting for an appointment.
          
          In the event that you fail to provide the required notice or miss your appointment without prior notification, we may apply a cancellation fee. The specific fee amount may depend on the length and type of the scheduled service. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to our cancellation policy.
          
          If you have any further questions or need to cancel or reschedule an appointment, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to assist you and provide exceptional service.
